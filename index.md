# The Title of the web site

In January 2020, we launched the CU Fellowship, which is our six-month, 
digital-first leadership program through which 200 exceptional high 
school-aged leaders, representing every region of America, come together 
to learn systems thinking, personal development, and participatory democracy.

The Fellowship culminates in the Fellows coming together in June 2020 to 
launch "Civics 2030," a national campaign to mobilize funds and support for 
leaders of Gen Z to spearhead projects that strengthen American democracy.
